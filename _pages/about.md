I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/">Eero Simoncelli</a> at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a>. My goal is to develop mathematical models of human perception.

Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.technion.ac.il/">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>, under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://elad.cs.technion.ac.il/">Michael Elad</a> and Prof. <a href="https://tomer.net.technion.ac.il/">Tomer Michaeli</a>.
